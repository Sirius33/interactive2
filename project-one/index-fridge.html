          <br>“White goods” is an odd phrase coming from the historical fact that most refrigerators, air conditioners, stoves, and similar durable consumer appliances, used to be universally painted with a white enamel finish. You can get them in all kinds of colours and finishes today, but they still get called “white goods”.
          <br>In 2014, 348,528 tonnes of white goods were diverted from the landfill in Canada! Unfortunately, many many more are still ending up in the landfill every year. Not only are they bulky and take up a lot of space, but they contain many valuable as well as polluting materials.
          <br>Depending on the age of the white goods, many contain switches that are mercury-containing. This persistent pollutant gets into our waterways easily, and bioaccumulates – meaning that organisms higher up the food chain end up with high concentrations of it when they consume many smaller organisms that have contacted mercury.
          <br>Refrigerants, found in air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, and a few other types of appliance, which known as CFC, HCFC, and HFCs – all just acronyms for the type of chemical compound they are. CFCs are the type that contribute to thinning in the ozone layer (which protects us from harmful UV radiation), and the other two (HCFCs and HFCs) do less damage to the ozone layer but are very powerful greenhouse gases. There are a few other refrigerants out there, such as Ammonia, HFs, and CFs, but they are much less commonly used.
