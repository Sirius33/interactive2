          <br>CD/DVD recycling is so easy because of the materials they’re made of. Even though CDs are made of highly valuable recyclable materials like polycarbonate plastic and aluminum, they’re not accepted in Novak single-stream recycling bins. CD recycling saves substantial amounts of energy and prevents significant amounts of both air and water pollution attributed to the manufacturing of these items from raw material.
          <br>Each year, billions of CDs (and DVDs) are manufactured, while millions are simply thrown away. They end up in landfills and incinerators, which causes unnecessary damage to our environment, wasted energy, and the loss of valuable resources. Landfills are not a viable disposal option because CDs don’t break down readily. Over time, CDs can release Bisphenol A (BPA), which can cause health implications in humans. Burning CDs releases toxic fumes into the air we breathe, and they require a special recycling process that isn’t accepted in single-stream recycling bins.
          <br>To manufacture a pound of plastic (30 CDs per pound), it requires 300 cubic feet of natural gas, 2 cups of crude oil and 24 gallons of water.
          <br>It is estimated that it will take over 1 million years for a CD to completely decompose in a landfill.
          <br>More than 5.5 million boxes of software go to landfills and incinerators, plus people throw away millions of music CDs each year.
          <br>Every month approximately 100,000 pounds of CDs become obsolete (outdated, useless, or unwanted).
