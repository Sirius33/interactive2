          The history of the Mechanics' Institute parallels the history of San Francisco itself. Benefiting from a rising tide of trade and prosperity in the city,the Mechanics' Institute built a permanent home on Post Street in 1866, garnered support from the University of California, and a bequest from James Lick (the wealthiest man in the state at the time of his death). In January 1906, the library absorbed a vast humanities-based collection held by the local Mercantile Library, bringing the library holdings to 200,000 books, give or take a few.

          Four months later, the 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed everything. That is, everything except the contents of two safes and a bronze cast of Lick. A new building, a new collection, and 157 years later, the Mechanics' Institute Library now boasts approximately 5,000 members and 165,000 volumes, but its original purpose -- acting as a hub for the exchange of ideas and skills -- is its most unique asset.
